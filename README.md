# Django XSS Fuzzer

An XSS vulnerability fuzz tester for Django views.

This tester will inject XSS patterns into the context data for a template before it is rendered, including:

- Simple strings
- Attributes of Django ORM objects in QuerySets

The goal of this tool is to quickly find any XSS vulnerabilities in Django templates.

Any successful injections will write a message to the browser JavaScript console.

## Installation

Install via pip

```console
$ pip install django-xss-fuzzer
```

Add `ViewFuzzerMiddleware` to your middleware list for a **test environment**.

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'django_xss_fuzzer.ViewFuzzerMiddleware'
]
```

**Do not deploy this to a production server!**

## Configuration

Configure the middleware via the Django global settings.

* `XSS_PATTERN` : An XSS patterns to try. See [XSS Cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet) for inspiration.
* `XSS_INJECT_KWARGS` (Default False) : A switch to disable injecting XSS view function keyword arguments
* `XSS_INJECT_CONTEXT_DATA` (Default True) : A switch to disable injecting XSS into class data

## Automated fuzzing with Pytest and Selenium

This package comes with a Pytest extension to add a parametrized fixture, `xss_pattern`.

Once you've restarted Django, it will replace anything "string-like" in the context data with a malicious string.
By default it will try `<script>throw onerror=eval,\'=console.log\x28\\\'{0}\\\'\x29\'</script>`.

The values that will be replaced :
- Any string variables
- Any attributes in a model instance that are strings
- Any attributes in a QuerySet containing data models that are strings

When you browse any of the pages on your site, you should see Django successfully protecting and escaping the strings.

![evil-page](https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/evil-page.png)

When you open the JavaScript console, if you see any `--SUCCESS[]--` messages this means your page is vulnerable, the name of the field that it replaced will be inside square brackets.

To change the malicious string, set the `XSS_PATTERN` variable in your Django settings.

It's designed to be paired with PyTest, PyTest-Django, and Selenium so that it will try a range of malicious strings until it finds a successful attack vector.

The selenium integration is required so that each view will be rendered and then processed by Chrome. Once Chrome has loaded the page, the tool will inspect the JavaScript log for any occurrences of `--SUCCESS[field]--`
and then fail the test if one is found.

Here is an example test for the URLs `/` and `/home`:

```python
import pytest


paths = (
    '/',
    '/home'
)


@pytest.mark.django_db()
@pytest.mark.parametrize('path', paths)
def test_xss_patterns(selenium, live_server, settings, xss_pattern, path):
    setattr(settings, 'XSS_PATTERN', xss_pattern.string)
    selenium.get('%s%s' % (live_server.url, path), )
    assert not xss_pattern.succeeded(selenium), xss_pattern.message
```

The test function `test_xss_patterns` is a parametrized test that will run a live server using `pytest-django` and open a browser for each test using `pytest-selenium`.
To test more views, just add the URIs to `paths`.

To setup selenium, add the following to your `conftest.py`:

```python
import pytest


@pytest.fixture(scope='session')
def session_capabilities(session_capabilities):
    session_capabilities['goog:loggingPrefs'] = {'browser': 'ALL'}
    return session_capabilities


@pytest.fixture
def chrome_options(chrome_options):
    chrome_options.headless = True
    return chrome_options
```

This will configure Chrome as headless and enable logging to capture the XSS flaws.

To run PyTest with this plugin, use the `--driver` flag as Chrome and `--driver-path` to point to a downloaded version of the Chrome Driver for the version of Chrome you have installed.

```console
 $ python -m pytest tests/ --driver Chrome --driver-path /path/to/chromedriver -rs -vv
```

Once this is running, you'll see something similar to the following output:

For each failed test, inspect that particular view with the attack string and see where the potential vulnerability is.

## What about Django's builtin XSS protection?

In 99% of cases, Django will sanitize the injection strings and they will be unsuccessful.

However, there are some limitations, such as unquoted expressions of HTML tag attributes

```html
<style class={{ var }}>...</style>
```

This extension would automatically replace `var` with `x onafterscriptexecute=console.log('found attribute-based xss in {0}')`.

Django would render the following HTML:

```html
<style class=x onafterscriptexecute=console.log('found attribute-based xss in {0}')>...</style>
```

The JavaScript code within the onafterscriptexecute would be run by the browser, demonstrating the vulnerability.

Other examples, would be the use of the `|safe` filter inside the Django template. This filter can be put into Django views without a full-understanding of the ramifications.

For example, in a permanent XSS attack, the database, or memory state could contain a dangerous string.

## Running in CI/CD

GitHub Actions has Chrome and Chromedriver preinstalled on the `ubuntu-latest` image.

You can run the tests with the same flag with the environment variable:

```yaml
    - name: Run Security Tests
      run: |
        python -m pytest tests/your_security_tests --driver Chrome --driver-path $CHROMEWEBDRIVER/chromedriver
```

Azure Pipelines uses the same image, but has a different syntax. You can run using a script task like this:

```yaml
- script: |
    pytest tests/your_security_tests --driver Chrome --driver-path $(CHROMEWEBDRIVER)/chromedriver
  displayName: 'Run Security tests'
```

Also use my [pytest-azurepipelines](https://github.com/tonybaloney/pytest-azurepipelines) extension to automate the publishing of test results to the pipelines UI.
